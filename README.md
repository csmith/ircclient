# <img alt="Tithon" src="/frontend/icon.png" height="50px"> Tithon - Modern desktop IRC client
Tithon is a modern, user-friendly (in theory) IRC Client, making use of many IRCv3 features to try and add those features other platforms make much easier, whilst still keeping to the spirit of IRC.

It is currently missing a lot of basic functionality, please do raise an issue if you spot something you want and isn't implemented.

## Installation

### Arch Linux
Tithon is available in the AUR:

### Debian/Ubuntu
.deb files are available on the [Releases page](../releases/latest).

## Getting Started
1. Add a new server connection using the icon in the bottom left
2. Join channels using the `/join #channelname` command

## Configuration
Tithon automatically saves your configuration when you exit the application. Your settings, server connections, etc. will be restored the next time you launch the application.  No GUI config is currently available, but you can configure notifications from the config file.  This can be located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tithon.yaml`
